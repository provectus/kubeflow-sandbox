# How to Contribute

Welcome to the SAKK project! We love feedback and contributions, and this guide outlines how one can contribute to SAKK. 


## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Issues

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to start discussing open issues in the comments below them. 
Check out SAKK Issues section, react with emoji, and comment: 
- [SAKK issues](https://github.com/provectus/sak-kubeflow/issues)

For example, you can find issues labeled with `roadmap` and let us know in the comments what you think about the proposed features, which of them you consider the most important and why. 

If you've found something in the repo that can be improved, check issues to see if someone has already reported it.
If it is something new, open a new issue and describe it in free form. We'll see it and discuss it with you in the comments.

If you're looking to start contributing to current tasks, check out issues labeled `good first issues`.  
- [Good first issues](https://github.com/provectus/sak-kubeflow/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

### 2. PRs (Pull Requests)

Ready to make a change? Fork SAKK repo, clone it, make your changes in a separate branch, push it to GitHub and open a PR. 
The process is pretty standard. You can use this PR contributing guide from SAKK's umbrella repository: 
- [Contributing PRs](https://github.com/provectus/swiss-army-kube/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTE_PR.md)

### 3. Roadmap

We are looking for feedback and participation in our Roadmap. Please share your thoughts, issues you currently struggle with while serving and managing Kubeflow on EKS at scale, and ideas on how SAKK can help your ML/DevOps teams to address them. Please discuss our Roadmap with us on Slack or under the issues tagged roadmap.   

### 4. Discussion
If you have any questions, comments, ideas, or need help, come to our Slack to discuss it: 

- [Join SAKK on Slack](https://sak-kubeflow.slack.com/)


### 5. Promotion 

We will be happy if you can share this repository or promote it in any other way - on GitHub, social networks, blog posts, etc. 
The easiest way is to press the watch, star, and fork buttons or share a link on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn. 
If you're writing a relevant blog post, include information about SAKK and share a link. 
If you're working on more elaborate forms of relevant content and want to share about SAKK, please contact us to discuss how we can help. 
We would be thrilled to amplify your voice.
